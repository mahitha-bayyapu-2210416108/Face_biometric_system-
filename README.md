# Face_biometric_system-
This project intended to build a face biometric system. The project is divided into two part by building 2 systems.
## Data set
Gallery and probe sets are the datasets used to validate the system. 

## Methods
- System A
* System B
## Sytem A
In this system, we present a fundamental face biometric system that utilizes raw pixel intensity values as features. Additionally, the system employs a normalized correlation coefficient as a comparator.
## System B
System B distinguishes itself from the basic face biometric system (System A) through its incorporation of advanced image processing techniques. Unlike System A, which relies on conventional data processing methods susceptible to noise and limited feature extraction, System B employs a sophisticated combination of filters:

- Gaussian Blur: Effectively reduces image noise and emphasizes important features.
- Canny: Facilitates precise edge detection, enhancing feature outlines.
- Prewitt: Identifies both vertical and horizontal edges in the image.
- Sobel: Accentuates edges in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- Scharr: Offers similar edge detection capabilities as Sobel, potentially outperforming it in specific scenarios.
  
This innovative filtering approach goes beyond traditional methods, not only improving noise reduction but also significantly enhancing feature extraction and visibility in facial biometrics.
